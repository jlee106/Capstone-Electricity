# 🔌 Capstone Project for Data Analytics Bootcamp: Analysing Singapore's Electricity Market

This project analyzes Singapore's electricity market with a focus on **Electricity Consumption**, **Peak System Demand vs Capacity**, and **Household Electricity Market**. It combines data analytics with strategic insights to support consumers, industry players, and regulators in decision-making.

## 📊 Project Scope

This project covers:
- Analysis of electricity consumption and peak system demand
- Peak system demand vs installed capacity comparison and reserve margin evaluation
- Trends in household electricity sector
- Open Electricity Market (OEM) impact on consumer choices
- Tariff prediction using time series forecasting (ARIMA, SARIMA, SARIMAX)
- Policy recommendations for EMA, Gencos, and Consumers

---

## 🧠 Key Questions Addressed
- What is Singapore's electricity consumption trend?
- Is Singapore producing enough power to meet peak demand?
- What drives the electricity tariff?
- What is the price outlook for electricity tariff (Low Tension Supplies - Domestic)?
- What should policymakers, Gencos and energy retailers do moving forward?
